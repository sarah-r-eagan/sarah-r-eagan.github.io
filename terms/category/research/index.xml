      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to focus our attention, we must inhibit distracting information. Most commonly, when we think of distractors, we think of sights and sounds that interfere with our ability to focus on a particular sight, sound, or task. Distractors are most commonly characterized as something in the external environment, such as a loud noise or bright light, but they can also be uninvited thoughts or memories that intrude on our mindstate, making it difficult to focus. In order to examine how our brain functions to ignore both types of distractors, we had participants complete a perceptual (externally oriented attention) and reflective (internally oriented attention) inhibition task while an MRI scanned their brain. Using this data, we plan to examine how certain locations in the brain respond to perceptual and reflective distractors of various categories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classifying Expertise from Eye Movement Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expertise can be defined by many different criteria. Sometimes there is an absolute threshold for expertise (i.e., certification), and other times expertise is judged in relative terms (i.e., comparing years of experience between two individuals). Being able to define expertise can be useful in numerous situations. Most notably for me, is the potential application of human assistive technology being able to anticipate the type of support individuals will need based on their level of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a second to imagine a scenario where you are teaching yourself a skill by participating in automated online computer tutorials. For instance, learning how to program. Now, say the computer is capable of monitoring your eye movements and determining how well you are progressing through the program - not based purely on performance, but based on where you focus your attention externally! Eye movements are one of many behaviors that can signal to the world (in an albeit subtle fashion) what you are thinking about. This kind of technology has the potential to advance the science of learning by highlighting important eye movement features that may be indicative of the cognitive processes relied on by experts. Furthermore, developing human assistive technology in this domain has the potential to improve learning trajectories and advance performance at a level that was possible in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, we are still at square one with trying to determine the most effective method for detecting expertise from behavior. Dr. Mike Dodd, Josh Zosky, and I are working in collaboration with computer scientist Dr. Bonita Sharif to determine the best method for determining expertise from the eye movements of programmers actively working to debug computer software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoding Eye Movement Data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where a computer could determine what you were thinking about by simply monitoring your eye movements. Scary, right? Well it turns out that if you have individuals look at the same image, but ask them to evaluate different characteristics of the image (e.g., &lt;em&gt;determine the age of the individuals in the image&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;name the individuals in the image&lt;/em&gt;.), the scan paths created by their eye movements have been shown to visibly differ between tasks. We&amp;rsquo;re exploring the most efficient and effective methods for making that happen! (But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, mind-reading robots are still very far off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working to teach the computer to use eye movement data to determine what an individual is thinking. More specifically, in this project we had participants search, rate, or memorize scene images while their eye movements were recorded. Then we fed a deep convolutional neural network the eye movement data formatted as a timeline (coordinates and pupil size), and as an image snapshot of each trial which was then categorized. Typically, classification models are built on a cognitive or neurobiological foundation. At the moment, we are interested in exploring the ability of a black box model to decode eye movement data using no explicit theoretical justiciation in the development of our model. Our models were developed using the deep learning toolbox, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://delineate.it&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DeLINEATE&lt;/a&gt;, developed by members of Dr. Johnson&amp;rsquo;s lab. Moving forward, we will continue to explore this neural network approach to decoding eye movement data, and other related questions concerning both theoretical and applied purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many young adults who attend a university do so with the hope of identifying and/or pursuing a career, sometimes their dream! For many, that dream is to be a scientist! In many instances, the dreams of these students are limited by the resources available to them, through the university, or otherwise. For this reason, the Preparing Undergraduates for Research in Stem-related fields using Electrophysiology (PURSUE) program was developed. PURSUE is meant to provide students at universities that are not capable of providing students with experience in a cognitive neuroscience laboratory (particularly EEG) a chance to get hands on experience going through tutorials covering every phase of an EEG experiment, designing an ERP study and analyzing data from a database. These experiences are valuable to undergradaute students in that hadns-on experience will provide them with a more in-depth knowledge of the method, and for those who wish to continue on to graduate school, will provide a simulated lab experience that can prepare a student for some of the tasks that would be required of them as a graduate student working in a laboratory that conducts EEG research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Refreshing Predictable Words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you think that your thoughts can influence how you see the world? As children, the shadows in our bedroom at night look like monsters (sometimes when we&amp;rsquo;re adults too ð¬). Or sometimes we read a word, then go back to realize it was a totally different word! Or on occasion, we may even mis-identify a person, place, or object. In one particularly intriguing example, 
&lt;a href=&#34;author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; showed that when the thought of a particular picture or word was the focus of attention immediately before the same word was presented, reaction times were slower than when a different picture or word was presented. In the paper describing these findings (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612466414&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johnson et al., 2013 - Foraging for Thought&lt;/a&gt;), 
&lt;a href=&#34;author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/&#34;&gt;Johnson&lt;/a&gt; et al. likened this outcome to a perceptual phenomena known as Inhibition of Return (IoR). The IoR effect is described as a deliberate delay in the return of attention to an item that was just previously the focus of attention. The IoR effect is often thought of as a mechanism of attention that is meant encourage the perceiver to build and maintain awareness of their surroundings by surveying the environment, rather than remaining hyper-focused on one item location in space. The findings presented in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612466414&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Foraging for Thought&lt;/a&gt; paper suggest that the mechanisms underlying the IoR effect might influnece attention on a global level, but to this date, almost all research has focused on the IoR effect while attention is focused externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that the mechanisms driving the IoR effect operate on a global scale, influencing attention that is focused externally (on sights and sounds) AND internally (on active thoughts). As such, we are currently working to probe the mechanisms underlying this phenomena by manipulating the probability that attention will be directed back to an item that was just the focus of internal attention (i.e., a thought brought up in working memory) immediately prior (a manipulation known to influence the traditional IoR effect). By exploring these effects, we will further our understanding of how internal and external attention systems interact, and how our thoughts influence our attention to items in the environment. In the future, we plan to expand on this line of research by incorporating different manipulations and collecting measurements of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running to Preferred Music</title>
      <link>/project/run_w_music/</link>

      <guid>/project/run_w_music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study began with a discussion of how local military personnel were not permitted to listen to music on their headphones during their physical training drills. From there, we decided to explore the infleunce of listening to preferred music on exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our exploration of the literature, we established that the major music-related factors playing a role in exercise performance were rhythm and tempo, volume, synchronization, musicality. Rhythm and tempo and volume are properties of the music that relate to physiological factors such as arousal and attention. Essentially, music at a particular tempo and volume may facilitate the exerciserâs ability to dissociate from the pain associated with exercise, which can improve affect and performance. Furthermore, rhythm and tempo can be used to control pace, and improve movement efficiency which can benefit speed and endurance. Finally, musicality is a property of the music relating to the abstract motivational properties of music (e.g., moving lyrics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, you may notice that all of these majorly established factors are properties of the music. We decided to focus on the perspective of the exerciser. For instance, consider when you go to a gym and there is music in the background. In this case, the background music is [usually] beyond the control of the listener, and may not be to their taste. For this reason, many individuals exercise wearing headphones or earphones. For the most part, we can probably assume that someone wearing headphones is going to listen to music that they prefer. So, we sought to find out whether there is there a difference in exercise performance between individuals who listen to preferred or non-preferred music?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, we had experienced runners complete a 12-minute run, and we measured the distance they ran while running to preferred music, non-preferred music, or no music. We found that female runners ran further when listening to preferred music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we can probably conclude from our research and other studies, that music generally improves exercise performance. When considering experienced runners or other endurance athletes, the potential for improvement is less. As such, listening to preferred music (c.f., non-preferred music) is less likely to provide a noticeable boost to performance. That considered, music preference has the potential to play an important role in motivation, which can be related to longer and more frequent workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up doors and windows for enhancing the human experience. In the same period, we have seen a growing concern for personal health and wellness. As such, physical activity monitors (PAMs) â most commonly wristbands or phone apps â have become a popular tool for individuals to self-monitor physical activity and set goals. At this point, there is not a lot of information regarding the use of PAMs. For this reason, 
&lt;a href=&#34;/author/darrell-l.-butler-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Darrell Butler&lt;/a&gt; and I conducted focus groups and large-scale surveys of PAM users to better understand their motivation for purchasing and using PAMs, in addition to observing the outcomes individuals with PAMs experience as a result of using the PAMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conceptual Grouping of Text and Pictures</title>
      <link>/project/cstm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conceptual grouping is a process that involves processing multiple concepts as a single entity. One popular form of conceptual grouping is chunking. Colloquially, chunking is a strategy explicitly carried out in order to improve memory. Humans are generally capable of holding about 5-7 items in memory at a time, so most may find it difficult to remember the following string fo numbers: &lt;code&gt;9851250923223&lt;/code&gt;. Now, I personally can chunk this string of numbers by recognizing that the first five numbers &lt;code&gt;98512&lt;/code&gt; is the zipcode for Olympia, WA; the next three numbers &lt;code&gt;509&lt;/code&gt; are an area code used in eastern Washington; and the last five numbers &lt;code&gt;23223&lt;/code&gt; are a zipcode for Richmond, VA. So, using my own established knowledge markers, this is actually a fairly easy set of numbers for me to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how often is it that you are required to memorize a long string of numbers like that?? Okay, occasionally. But thinking more practically, we can consider the more complicated process played by conceptual grouping while reading. As you read a letter, you recall its properties. As you read a word, those letters are grouped into a concept. As you read a sentence, those singular concepts are grouped into a more collective concept. As you read a paragraph, that collective of sentences is unified into a more singular concept. Now letâs think about this. Do you remember the last seven words you read? (Okay, maybe you do..). Do you think you could recall the past five sentences word-for-word? Or, lets make it easier. How about just recalling the topic of each of the past five sentences? That sounds pretty difficult, but I imagine you could probably recall the topic of the last paragraph or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I think you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, this study looked at the combination of words and images. It is very common for reading materials, whether they be a textbook, magazine, or a news article, to have images accompanying the main text. Sometimes these images are related to the text, other times they are not. We wondered, do unrelated images disrupt the complex process of conceptual grouping while reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we presented participants with cryptic paragraphs, presented one word at a time. Mixed in with the paragraphs were images that were either related, or unrelated to the paragraph. We asked participants to recall the paragraph as well as they could, then to describe the topic of the paragraph. We also had the participants identify the image they were shown (when an image was presented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to conclude that memory for the paragraph and image was not changed by the relationship of the image to the paragraph, but when presented with an unrelated image, participants were less capable of identifying the topic of the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a second! The memory for the paragraph was the same, but the participants were not able to understand as well what it meant! These findings have widespread implications with regard to the combination of text and images in reading materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Audiovisual (AV) sensory integration is a vital aspect of communication in everyday life. During speech perception, predictive information from the lips is used to amplify the auditory signal (for a really cool demonstration of this effect, search for videos of the McGurk Effect). AV integration is a process that could substantially improve second language (L2) learning, if applied properly. In many instances, L2 students learn from reading words while listening to pronunciations. There is some doubt as to whether written word provides the necessary predictive information to amplify the auditory signal, particularly when the native alphabet doesnât match the L2 alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we ran two experiments where native English speakers listened to Spanish words while they were simultaneously presented with the same word spelled according to Spanish or English conventions. In the first experiment, participants were asked to mimic the sound they heard. In the second experiment, the participants were asked to indicated which letter the word started with, and to indicate how confident they were in their response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, we found that changing how the words were spelled affected the participantsâ hearing. This means that orthographic information can affect auditory processing, and what is really interesting is that this relationship may be predicated on relevant linguistic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time-on-task is often the main concern of individuals planning or reflecting on their preparation an exam. For instance, a teacher may give out recommendations for how long studnets should spend studying for the exma. Or a student may determine that they are prepared by recounting how many hours they spent studying the topic to be examined. The issue with this focus is that task efficiency is often ignored when considering what methods of preparation a student will use to study for the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, most undergraduates are aware that compared to elaborative study strategies, memorization can be less efficient and effective. Despite understanding this, students still rely very heavily on memorizing and regurgitating facts. It does not help matters that even some of the scientific literature focuses on how memorization is improved with increased time-on-task (while ignoring study strategy). In this vein, my advisor and I 
&lt;a href=&#34;/author/darrell-l.-butler-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Darrell Butler&lt;/a&gt; noticed that some of the learning literature appeared to mischaracterize the cognitive effects of study time. Particularly, we found that students who studied longer performed better on tests were considered by some to have obtained a deeper level of knowledge for the topic-at-had. Now, what is important to understand here is that depth of knowledge is built on associations between a variety of information sources. This means that reading, and re-reading the same source does not necessarily result in a deeper level of knowledge, although it may strengthen the memory for that particular material. This means that, theoretically, a shorter study time could be associated with an increased depth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, and disentangle the effects of study time and study strategy on test performance. To do this, we ran two experiments. In both experiments, participants were given an article to read, flashcards to study, and a test to take. The participants studied either deep or shallow level flashcards. In the first experiment, study time was not controlled. In the second experiment, there was a short study time and long study time group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we were able to confirm that increased study time and more elaborate (deeper) study strategies improved test performance. Furthermore, these effects were not connected, but rather work independently to improve test performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing Conceptual Organization Using Concept Maps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organization is necessary for understanding complex concepts. Conceptual organization is developed by establishing associative connections between individual concepts. In order to develop these associations, the learner must consider the relationship between concepts. The trouble is, so many college students rely heavily on memorization strategies when studying  (e.g., memorizing flashcards or re-reading notes or materials). While repetitive recitation strategies can improve memory for particular concepts, these memorization techniques do not provide much, if any, relational information. This means that students often concentrate on learning concepts in isolation, but may not fully understand how these concepts are related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will generally study to prepare for the demands of the test. As such, tests that require students to exhibit an organizational understanding are used to motivate students to concentrate on organizing learned concepts. To this end, concept maps are becoming an increasingly attractive test format for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the tough part: How do you measure organization? In this study, we tested organization by considering connectedness. We did this by accounting for inaccurate connections in the concept map. When two concepts were inaccurately connected, the two concepts were graded as separate, resulting in multiple âtreesâ in the graded concept map. Graded concept maps with a larger number of trees were considered less connected, and thus exhibited a less organized understanding for the learned material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test organization, we ran multiple experiments comparing learning outcomes for students using concept map, outline, and list study and test formats. Generally speaking, we found that concept maps study and test formats encourage students to develop an organized understanding for the learned material, and outlines were consistently better than lists.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many young adults who attend a university do so with the hope of identifying and/or pursuing a career, sometimes their dream! For many, that dream is to be a scientist! In many instances, the dreams of these students are limited by the resources available to them, through the university, or otherwise. For this reason, the Preparing Undergraduates for Research in Stem-related fields using Electrophysiology (PURSUE) program was developed. PURSUE is meant to provide students at universities that are not capable of providing students with experience in a cognitive neuroscience laboratory (particularly EEG) a chance to get hands on experience going through tutorials covering every phase of an EEG experiment, designing an ERP study and analyzing data from a database. These experiences are valuable to undergradaute students in that hadns-on experience will provide them with a more in-depth knowledge of the method, and for those who wish to continue on to graduate school, will provide a simulated lab experience that can prepare a student for some of the tasks that would be required of them as a graduate student working in a laboratory that conducts EEG research.&lt;/p&gt;

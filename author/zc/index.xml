      <title>Competition in Reflective and Perceptual Attention</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to focus our attention, we must inhibit distracting information. Most commonly, when we think of distractors, we think of sights and sounds that interfere with our ability to focus on a particular sight, sound, or task. Distractors are most commonly characterized as something in the external environment, such as a loud noise or bright light, but they can also be uninvited thoughts or memories that intrude on our mindstate, making it difficult to focus. In order to examine how our brain functions to ignore both types of distractors, we had participants complete a perceptual (externally oriented attention) and reflective (internally oriented attention) inhibition task while an MRI scanned their brain. Using this data, we plan to examine how certain locations in the brain respond to perceptual and reflective distractors of various categories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Noob Perspective on Building a Website</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/post/a-noobs-perspective-on-building-a-website_for-noobs/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurophysicole.com/post/a-noobs-perspective-on-building-a-website_for-noobs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have setup two websites of my own in addition to developing a couple of other professional websites, but I am certainly not an expert (definitely feel more like a noob than anything). At this point I have established enough of a baseline knowledge of how this all works, so I figured I would share with the world what I have learned, pass along some recommendations, and provide some walk-throughs of what you need to know to build your own website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the story here is that a couple of years ago I decided build my own personal website to increase the visibility of my research, and to provide a platform for sharing my knowledge/thoughts/ideas with the world! Having cut my teeth in web development using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I am talking about here, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it), I figured I would try and stick with what I knew. I decided to use a free theme on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. It was fun to build the site, and I was able to design it exactly as I wanted, but in the end, adding content and updating the site became quite a ponderous task - which isn&amp;rsquo;t great when your spare time is limited! So, after a while the website was basically dormant, which didn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with me.. but working on it was such as hassle! Boo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, my website is supposed to be a side project that is part fun and interesting, part professional development, and part something I can do when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to think &lt;em&gt;tooooo&lt;/em&gt; hard. Sometimes I need a brain-break, but I can&amp;rsquo;t (or don&amp;rsquo;t want to) totally shut off, you know what I mean? But with how my initial website was designed, it took a great deal of effort to remember how all of the pieces fit together, and how to even add content like I wanted to..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;Quick note&lt;/em&gt;: This is not a post to bash 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; websites. I know how some of you peeps think, and I just want to get out ahead of that type of thought! This post is only meant to describe my personal knowledge and experience, which certainly is the end-all be-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, after a while of being fed up, and after having a little more spare time than usual (kind of), I decided to go the route of building a website using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Having recently (within the last year or two) discovered 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and the wonders of Git (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I am talking about, here is a link to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Git Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). I recently discovered that you could build a website on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and immediately thought that this would be a much more manageable and fun way to build and maintain my website. Now, all of my wbepages are built in Markdown (which I love), and just pushed straight from my computer to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository hosting the site. At this point it is still pretty early, but I think I have found what I am looking for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-i-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point-and-click websites can be fun and easy (kind of) to build, but are a pain to maintain and update (at least in my experience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point-and-click can come with unexpected expenses, especially if you are interested in plugins or widgets that come with a cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need a ton of technical expertise to build a good website, whether it is developed using point-and-click or more traditional programming methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do or buy, research it beforehand! And while doing your research, look up to see how helpful the community resources are! No matter what route you go, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to run into problems, and generally, if you choose carefully, you&amp;rsquo;ll be building on a platform that is well documented and has an active community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be free, it can be cheap, or it can be pricey, and that is completely up to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walk-throughs&#34;&gt;Walk-Throughs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough with the story telling. In order to keep the information load manageable and organized, I have provided links below to walk-throughs outlining what I have done to develop sites in the past, and what I am currently doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely zero technical/programming expertise needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of resources for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of widgets/plugins to build a custom site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can get spendy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ponderous to maintain and update.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap (or free).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Git!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to fester and tinker with general formatting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;cons-1&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires some basic knowledge of Markdown (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here is a link to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Markdown Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires an understanding of how Git works.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Building a Website Using Git Pages</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/post/github-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurophysicole.com/post/github-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This method requires a basic understanding of how Git works, and how Markdown works. These aren&amp;rsquo;t super complex systems, but definitely come with a little bit of a learning curve. This is a place to get started, and from here it will just take time to get a handle on everything. In the end, if you are in academia or writing, or if you are doing any remotely technical work, understanding Git and understanding Markdown will actually pay off for you bigtime in the end! I &lt;strong&gt;highly&lt;/strong&gt; recommend this approach!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-pages&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the appraoch that I am pushing here is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Doing this, your domain is setup and your content is hosted. If you want, you can still setup your own domain name, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to (the domain will default to username.github.io). The framework that I use and will be describing is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. The 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; theme that I will be describing is 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt;. The whole thing is managed by pushing to a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-name&#34;&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we will be discussing domain name options. As I mentioned above, using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything to setup a domain name, but you can. Having a domain essentially means that you own a web address. For instance, my domain is 
&lt;a href=&#34;neurophysicole.com&#34;&gt;neurophysicole.com&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow the link, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice though that the web address changes to &lt;code&gt;neurophysicole.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. This is essentially because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bother with the process of getting that to change. I setup the domain to forward. This way, I can tell people to go to &lt;code&gt;neurophysicole.com&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;neurophysicole.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, which is a little more ponderous (neurophysicole is already long and crazy enough!). Now, just because I am just using a forwarding address, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you can&amp;rsquo;t explicitly attach your domain to your website. I may eventually fully replace the github.io domain, but at the moment I am not really inspired to go down that rabbit hole. For more information on how to do that, check this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages documentation&lt;/a&gt; page outlining the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional perk to having a domain is that I have an email address attached. In the past 5 or 6 years, I have been at three universities. And I plan to move on to a new one in the next few years! My email is constantly changing! So, I figure this is a good way to keep a consistent email. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have the email setup, I have an email address attached to my domain that forwards to whatever email I am using as my primary at the time. It is so easy to setup and I feel like the payoff is totally worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up a domain is very easy. I only have experience doing it through one service: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt;. The customer service is great, and the interface is incredibly easy to use. Setting up the additional domain name means that this is no longer a free option. The price for my domain was reasonable, and the additional price for the email forwarding was cheap, so altogether, it seems like a solid payoff for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the website is hosted on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. This means that if you do not already have a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account, you need to set one up. GitHub has moved everything to free accounts, so setting up your page is totally free! Once you create an account, you need to create a repository (sometimes referred to as a &amp;lsquo;repo&amp;rsquo;) named &amp;lsquo;&lt;code&gt;your username&lt;/code&gt;.github.io&amp;rsquo;. Initialize it with a README. Now, your site is up and running! &amp;hellip; But empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Going from here, you kinda need to know how Git works. If you are lost with that, I would recommend looking at the resources available on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something else we should do while we&amp;rsquo;re on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is to setup another repo. You can name this one whatever you want. For example, mine is &lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, now that you have the repos setup online, it is time to take advantage of the beauty of Git! Clone your repos to your computer. (This is a very basic Git process, so I am not going to explain &amp;ndash; but there are tons of reources on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and other great blogs I am sure..)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rmarkdown&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are going to divert real quick to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt; stuff, but will come back to the Git stuff right after. Order is important here, so I would just recommend following along. So, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with Markdown, here is a link to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Markdown Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, it is a way to create a document without having to really worry about formatting. Additionally, it is a document type that works well for blogs. For instance, this post was written entirely in a Markdown document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt; is a form of Markdown that is built within the open-source software 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. The reason we use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt; is because there are packages that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt; needs to function. So, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, or don&amp;rsquo;t know how to use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;, you are probably going to have a bit of a curve here, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try and help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if we&amp;rsquo;re starting from scratch, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to download 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.r-project.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. After that, download 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R Studio&lt;/a&gt;, enter the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#39;blogdown&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;- installs the main package that we&amp;rsquo;ll be working from: 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;R Studio&lt;/a&gt;, select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;New Project&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code&gt;New Directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code&gt;Website using blogdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the folder you want to make your site in (I&amp;rsquo;d recommend making it the same name as your main website repo - whatever it is. e.g., &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your site in the sub-directory of the &lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt; repo you made (or, whatever you decided to name it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select &lt;code&gt;Install Hugo automatically&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Add sample blog posts&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Add the example site of the theme&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Convert all metadata to YAML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Hugo theme: input &lt;code&gt;gcushen/hugo-academic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(&#39;blogdown&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; activates the package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; activates a local server so you can see your website! Run this line whenever you want to see your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should see the site you are working with in the Viewer! What you are viewing is a template, but it helps to see what is there. You can choose to edit the existing content, or you can create your own content. The example site is one page, but you can add others by adding folders in your site with an &lt;code&gt;index.md&lt;/code&gt; file (name the folder what you want the page to be named). If you want to have a link in the menu on the top bar of your website, update the &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;menus.toml&lt;/code&gt;. While we&amp;rsquo;re in this folder, keep in mind, the &lt;code&gt;.toml&lt;/code&gt; files in this folder set the basic settings for the entire website. Feel free to explore. For more information, check 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have the freedom now to do what you want! After making a change, enter &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt; to see what it will look like!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hugo-vs-jekyll&#34;&gt;Hugo vs. Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, I use a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; framework. If you look at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; documentation, that system is built mainly to work with a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; framework. This makes things a little tricky, but we&amp;rsquo;ll work it out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that this is the point in the development of my own site that I ran into the most issues. I had been working off of a couple of other blogs describing what they had done, and that kind of led me astray. I think in the end, whatever they did worked for them, but it was either outdated information, or I just wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to replicate it for some reason. There are multiple solutions to this issue of getting the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; framework to play nice with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, I think what I have come up with seems to work really well, and is really easy to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we have to get our site online. In the file structure of your website, there is a &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt; converts the .md (Markdown) files into .html (I think), and these converted files are stored in the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder. This is what we need to get on your &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo. If we do this properly, we&amp;rsquo;ll have your site up and running shortly! So, what we need to do is copy the files from the folder made when you cloned your &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo to your computer. There should be a README, and one or two hidden files (e.g., &lt;code&gt;.git&lt;/code&gt;). The important ones are the hidden files. There is more than one way to do this. I am using a Mac, so if you are using a PC, things might be a little wonky. But I think you can set your file explorer settings to show hidden files, then you can just copy over the files. If you are using a Mac, I recommend the using the following code in the Terminal app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp -a folder_path/username.github.io_folder/.* folder_path/z_site_folder/username.github.io_Rmarkdown_website_folder/public/&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves the website repo into the public folder (this is what we need for the website to work)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cp -a folder_path/username.github.io_folder/* folder_path/z_site_folder/username.github.io_Rmarkdown_website_folder/public/&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves the README, and any other files you have created, into the public folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm -rf folder_path/username.github.io_folder&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; removes old cloned repo - we don&amp;rsquo;t need it anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check that we are all good, you can check the status of your repo by entering the following lines in the Terminal app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd folder_path/username.github.io_folder&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves into the secondary (&lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt;) repo folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; should bring up the files that were added to the folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd public&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves into the main website repo folder (this can be kinda confusing, but it is the &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; repo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; should bring up the files that were added to this folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as a quick recap before we go live with the website. We have created our site in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt;, then we have moved it into the secondary repo folder (mine is called &lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt;), then we copied the files from our main repo into the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder created by the website. This public folder contains the files we want in the repo that we originally setup for our website. So, this means now that we have a repo-inception where we have the secondary repo containing all of our files (&lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt;), and we have the main repo (&lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;) within that repo. Although we have this repo-inception going on, we still have to update both repos. If you use a Git software, you can use that, but if you want to do it in the Terminal app, use the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd folder_path/username.github.io_folder&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves into the secondary (&lt;code&gt;z_site&lt;/code&gt;) repo folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; adds everything to the queue to be committed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Log what you did here.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; compiles and commits all of the changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; pushes your changes to the secondary repo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd public&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; moves into the main website repo folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; adds everything to the queue to be committed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git commit -am &amp;quot;Log what you did here. Can be the same message as the other commit.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; compiles and commits all of the changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt; &amp;lt;&amp;ndash; pushes your changes to the main website repo - your site should be online now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay! We should be all good now! Now, just remember that in order for your changes to be expressed on the website, you have to run the following code in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RMarkdown&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt; so the .md files are converted to the .html files and moved into the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re here, I have something to share with you, and don&amp;rsquo;t be mad.. but I promise the stuff we just did was the best way to go. Now, if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with two repos, you can just create a repo for the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder, and not worry about the secondary repo. The reason I like to roll with two repos is that if anything happens with the content outside of the public folder, your whole wesbite is lost (or, at least incapable of being updated). Having that Git repo is bigtime! That is the beauty of Git! Use it!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-your-site&#34;&gt;Updating Your Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re setup now! Make it yours. Spend some time reading through the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Academic documentation&lt;/a&gt;, get familiar with the file system and how it works. Customize the things you need for the site to be yours! Or don&amp;rsquo;t, that&amp;rsquo;s up to you! As part of your initial development process, I would recommend that you build templates for your posts. You will save time by just copying the files into the folder that you need, updating the YAML header, and adding in the content that you want. And I would recommend looking at the Hugo example when you are trying to figure out how to do something. At this point, it&amp;rsquo;s all yours. Have fun with it. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;point-and-click-using-wordpress&#34;&gt;Point-and-Click Using WordPress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much that I just cannot cover, it really is just best to look at the relevant documentation. I think I wasted probably ~6 hours trying to get things working because I was working off of some blogs that were misleading (hopefully I don&amp;rsquo;t do that to you!), so although it is nice to get the information condensed from blogs and such, it is probably best just to go straight to the source. Also, the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages documentation&lt;/a&gt; and the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo-Academic documentation&lt;/a&gt; is pretty great! If you have gotten to this point, and you think that maybe this is not the route for you to take, checkout my other blog outlining what you need to know to setup a blog site using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and some advice based on what I have done in the past:

      <title>Building a Website Using WordPress</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/post/wordpress-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurophysicole.com/post/wordpress-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite this method requiring no real technical/programming expertise, there is still a learning curve. The following is a guide to help you through the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;domain-name&#34;&gt;Domain Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will have to find yourself a domain name. Obviously, go with something that is relevant, easy to remember, and hopefully easy to spell (say that again, slowly&amp;hellip;then spell neurophysicole..haha). Something that I did learn, was that if you are able to attach your website to another highly trafficked website, your page will be more likely to show up in Google searches and such. For example, if your University offers blog space, you could create your own attached url (e.g., blogname.university.edu). The university may give some push-back if you choose to go with blogname.university.edu, and may try to push you more towards a university.edu/blogname url (saying this from experience). Either way, it is still generally recommended that you use the university resources if possible. This will save you money, and probably help with the visibility of your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, if you are not satisfied with your domain name, you can purchase a domain and set it to forward to your university url. This way you can still advertise your website as you would like, but can save time/money/effort in setting up hosting and other things. It just makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When purchasing a domain, there are a variety of options. I am not an expert, but in my discussions with individuals who seem to know what they are talking about, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; has been the most highly recommended company to go through. In my experience, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hover.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hover&lt;/a&gt; has been great with customer support and their system is relatively simple to use (I don&amp;rsquo;t have experience with other companies, so I cannot speak too much in comparison, but I have heard some negative things about other popular options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hosting&#34;&gt;Hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if you are not using an already established site (i.e., using a university or company url), you will need to setup a hosting option. This is something that I was completely unaware of going in, and I think is probably where the majority of your cost will be (often times these hosting companies offer a really cheap Year 1 price, then hike it up bigtime for Year 2, and so on). You might be asking yourself, what is hosting and why do I need it?? Well, web hosts essentially provide space on a server to hold all of the content of your website. Think of purchasing web hosting as purchasing space on a hard drive where your website will be stored. Additionally, hosts will provide tools for screening your site for viruses, provide email options, and other things (that I cannot think of off of the top of my head).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to consider when selecting a host are their reputation as far as how fast your website loads, and how reliable it will be (how often your site will crash). Things that matter are how much traffic you expect to have to your website, and how much information you plan to store on your site (including email). You&amp;rsquo;ll have to look at the hosts themselves to know for sure how your needs will affect cost. As far as I know, there are two main differences between hosts: (1) Some provide you with your own section on a server, others offer shared space on a server. The shared server will work fine for smaller sites (personal, or maybe even for your average research lab), but they are &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely to have issues as far as crashing and slowdowns are concerned; (2) Shared services are cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as a recommendation goes, I think the most highly rated options are 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bluehost.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BlueHost&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.siteground.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SiteGround&lt;/a&gt;. I personally have used 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.siteground.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SiteGround&lt;/a&gt;, and their service was great. The user interface is admittedly not-at-all intuitive (probably the worst user interface I have ever used..). Fortunately, I did not have to check it often, but setting everything up was a little more difficult than I would have liked. Overall, I was very happy with the service, but like I have said in the past, I do not have any reference for comparison, so other options could very well be just as viable, or better/easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;content-management&#34;&gt;Content Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, you will have to make a decision regarding content management. I tend to think of this as the operating system for your website. There are numerous options, but the overwhelming majority of the internet is built on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it is fairly easy to find support when developing a website using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot speak to the other systems, but I would say if you not an experienced web-developer, and are not trying to become an expert, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; is probably a good way to go. Everything that I discuss from here-on-out will be within the context of a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wordpress-theme&#34;&gt;WordPress Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; themes are essentially the template that you will use to build your website around (color scheme, layout, basic features, etc.). Each theme has its own preset structure, and they all vary in their additional features and support. Things to consider when choosing a theme are (of course) the layout, cost, and the support. There are free themes, and there are $$ themes. Anyone can develop a theme. As such, some random person or small group (more likely to be open source) is less likely to provide long-term support for their theme, as compared to some of the more popular options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I believe that 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most popular theme chosen for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. This is not an open source theme, but is very easy to use. You do not have to know how to program (for the most part, at least), and there are a lot of options for your layout. Furthermore, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; is very well supported, and there are a lot of easy to find solutions for common problems. Finally, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; comes with a ton of built-in widgets and plugins that are often updated. If cost is not an object (at least on this level), then I would highly recommend going with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; for your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my own website, I decided to try something open source (if you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure what I am talking about when I mention &amp;lsquo;open source&amp;rsquo;, check out the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenSource website&lt;/a&gt;). After quite a bit of research, and some trial-and-error, I decided to go with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://oceanwp.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OceanWP&lt;/a&gt;. This theme has provided me with the flexibility I needed to customize the features I am particular about, uses a GUI base (not requiring programming skills), appears to be fairly well-supported, and is compatible with a lot of great plugins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plugins&#34;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, if you did not (or do not intend to) purchase 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt;, you will probably require some plugins to get your website functioning as you would like to (I did, at least). Things to think about for plugins are generally the same as the themes. Things that plugins can be useful for are organizing your site and the working environment, and any other specialized customization you might want to attempt. The plugins that I used are 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://elementor.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Elementor&lt;/a&gt; (for a more advanced GUI based working environment for developing the website), 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.contentviewspro.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Content Views&lt;/a&gt; (to organize my blog layout), 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blog2social.com/en/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Blog2Social&lt;/a&gt; (to automatically share my posts to my attached social media). These will require some research on your own, depending on what you want your site to be capable of.. but I would recommend these as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developing-your-site&#34;&gt;Developing Your Site&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, now you have to develop your website. This is the fun part! Anyways, as a general principle I would recommend (as it was recommended to me) to create the parts of your site that will be updated by making them blog posts (this way they can be developed in one place, organized, and added automatically). Second, work with templates! Everything will be easier, especially if you are developing a blog such as this one, if you just have a general template you work with, making minor tweaks here and there. Along these lines, I would recommend working with the layout of the site as much as possible. The more you try and change the layout, the more difficult it will be to develop and maintain. Furthermore, if you are a person that does not have a lot of undedicated free time, you are probably not going to be able to continually update your site - and if you do have the time, I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will get old at some point. The point is, once your site is developed, you are just going to want to add content. If you have to keep making adjustments, the addition of content just isn&amp;rsquo;t going to happen (a) because you don&amp;rsquo;t have the time, and/or (b) because you&amp;rsquo;re tired of working on your site and do not want to do it. (I have experienced both).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-github-pages&#34;&gt;Using GitHub Pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, all that should get you through the basics of building your own blog site. All this said, I personally prefer to build my site using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; and Git. For this reason, and also because 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; is an effective no-cost option, I completely re-built my website into what it is now using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. That said, there are other point-and-click no-cost options, but the opions I came across just weren&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted. This 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; option is free, and I just like it better! I am generally a &amp;ldquo;you get what you pay for&amp;rdquo; guy, but here, I think I have found a possible exception (in my case, it seems more like a &amp;ldquo;you get out what you put in&amp;rdquo; situation). To see how I re-built my website using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, check out this blog post:

For me, this project was my first experience analyzing fMRI data (I have since been involved in multiple other fMRI projects - stay tuned!). With the guidance of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://neurophysicole.com/author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd&#34;&gt;Dr. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, I contributed to the processing, analysis, and reporting of our findings. The results from our lab (and many others) were collated by the central group running the project. The different reports were analyzed to determine how decisions were made at various points of the analyses, and how these decisions affected the reported outcome of the analysis. While findings reported from fMRI and othere complex analyses are often taken as relatively objective, this study brings to light the importance of open science and replication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Classifying Expertise from Eye Movement Data</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/project/expertise_eye_tracking/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurophysicole.com/project/expertise_eye_tracking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expertise can be defined by many different criteria. Sometimes there is an absolute threshold for expertise (i.e., certification), and other times expertise is judged in relative terms (i.e., comparing years of experience between two individuals). Being able to define expertise can be useful in numerous situations. Most notably for me, is the potential application of human assistive technology being able to anticipate the type of support individuals will need based on their level of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a second to imagine a scenario where you are teaching yourself a skill by participating in automated online computer tutorials. For instance, learning how to program. Now, say the computer is capable of monitoring your eye movements and determining how well you are progressing through the program - not based purely on performance, but based on where you focus your attention externally! Eye movements are one of many behaviors that can signal to the world (in an albeit subtle fashion) what you are thinking about. This kind of technology has the potential to advance the science of learning by highlighting important eye movement features that may be indicative of the cognitive processes relied on by experts. Furthermore, developing human assistive technology in this domain has the potential to improve learning trajectories and advance performance at a level that was possible in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this said, we are still at square one with trying to determine the most effective method for detecting expertise from behavior. Dr. Mike Dodd, Josh Zosky, and I are working in collaboration with computer scientist Dr. Bonita Sharif to determine the best method for determining expertise from the eye movements of programmers actively working to debug computer software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Decoding Eye Movement Data</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/project/deepeye/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where a computer could determine what you were thinking about by simply monitoring your eye movements. Scary, right? Well it turns out that if you have individuals look at the same image, but ask them to evaluate different characteristics of the image (e.g., &lt;em&gt;determine the age of the individuals in the image&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;name the individuals in the image&lt;/em&gt;.), the scan paths created by their eye movements have been shown to visibly differ between tasks. We&amp;rsquo;re exploring the most efficient and effective methods for making that happen! (But don&amp;rsquo;t worry, mind-reading robots are still very far off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working to teach the computer to use eye movement data to determine what an individual is thinking. More specifically, in this project we had participants search, rate, or memorize scene images while their eye movements were recorded. Then we fed a deep convolutional neural network the eye movement data formatted as a timeline (coordinates and pupil size), and as an image snapshot of each trial which was then categorized. Typically, classification models are built on a cognitive or neurobiological foundation. At the moment, we are interested in exploring the ability of a black box model to decode eye movement data using no explicit theoretical justiciation in the development of our model. Our models were developed using the deep learning toolbox, 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://delineate.it&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DeLINEATE&lt;/a&gt;, developed by members of Dr. Johnson&amp;rsquo;s lab. Moving forward, we will continue to explore this neural network approach to decoding eye movement data, and other related questions concerning both theoretical and applied purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many young adults who attend a university do so with the hope of identifying and/or pursuing a career, sometimes their dream! For many, that dream is to be a scientist! In many instances, the dreams of these students are limited by the resources available to them, through the university, or otherwise. For this reason, the Preparing Undergraduates for Research in Stem-related fields using Electrophysiology (PURSUE) program was developed. PURSUE is meant to provide students at universities that are not capable of providing students with experience in a cognitive neuroscience laboratory (particularly EEG) a chance to get hands on experience going through tutorials covering every phase of an EEG experiment, designing an ERP study and analyzing data from a database. These experiences are valuable to undergradaute students in that hadns-on experience will provide them with a more in-depth knowledge of the method, and for those who wish to continue on to graduate school, will provide a simulated lab experience that can prepare a student for some of the tasks that would be required of them as a graduate student working in a laboratory that conducts EEG research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Refreshing Predictable Words</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you think that your thoughts can influence how you see the world? As children, the shadows in our bedroom at night look like monsters (sometimes when we&amp;rsquo;re adults too ð¬). Or sometimes we read a word, then go back to realize it was a totally different word! Or on occasion, we may even mis-identify a person, place, or object. In one particularly intriguing example, 
&lt;a href=&#34;author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Johnson&lt;/a&gt; showed that when the thought of a particular picture or word was the focus of attention immediately before the same word was presented, reaction times were slower than when a different picture or word was presented. In the paper describing these findings (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612466414&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Johnson et al., 2013 - Foraging for Thought&lt;/a&gt;), 
&lt;a href=&#34;author/matthew-r.-johnson-phd/&#34;&gt;Johnson&lt;/a&gt; et al. likened this outcome to a perceptual phenomena known as Inhibition of Return (IoR). The IoR effect is described as a deliberate delay in the return of attention to an item that was just previously the focus of attention. The IoR effect is often thought of as a mechanism of attention that is meant encourage the perceiver to build and maintain awareness of their surroundings by surveying the environment, rather than remaining hyper-focused on one item location in space. The findings presented in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797612466414&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Foraging for Thought&lt;/a&gt; paper suggest that the mechanisms underlying the IoR effect might influnece attention on a global level, but to this date, almost all research has focused on the IoR effect while attention is focused externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suspicion is that the mechanisms driving the IoR effect operate on a global scale, influencing attention that is focused externally (on sights and sounds) AND internally (on active thoughts). As such, we are currently working to probe the mechanisms underlying this phenomena by manipulating the probability that attention will be directed back to an item that was just the focus of internal attention (i.e., a thought brought up in working memory) immediately prior (a manipulation known to influence the traditional IoR effect). By exploring these effects, we will further our understanding of how internal and external attention systems interact, and how our thoughts influence our attention to items in the environment. In the future, we plan to expand on this line of research by incorporating different manipulations and collecting measurements of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Running to Preferred Music</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/project/run_w_music/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://neurophysicole.com/project/run_w_music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This study began with a discussion of how local military personnel were not permitted to listen to music on their headphones during their physical training drills. From there, we decided to explore the infleunce of listening to preferred music on exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through our exploration of the literature, we established that the major music-related factors playing a role in exercise performance were rhythm and tempo, volume, synchronization, musicality. Rhythm and tempo and volume are properties of the music that relate to physiological factors such as arousal and attention. Essentially, music at a particular tempo and volume may facilitate the exerciserâs ability to dissociate from the pain associated with exercise, which can improve affect and performance. Furthermore, rhythm and tempo can be used to control pace, and improve movement efficiency which can benefit speed and endurance. Finally, musicality is a property of the music relating to the abstract motivational properties of music (e.g., moving lyrics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, you may notice that all of these majorly established factors are properties of the music. We decided to focus on the perspective of the exerciser. For instance, consider when you go to a gym and there is music in the background. In this case, the background music is [usually] beyond the control of the listener, and may not be to their taste. For this reason, many individuals exercise wearing headphones or earphones. For the most part, we can probably assume that someone wearing headphones is going to listen to music that they prefer. So, we sought to find out whether there is there a difference in exercise performance between individuals who listen to preferred or non-preferred music?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this, we had experienced runners complete a 12-minute run, and we measured the distance they ran while running to preferred music, non-preferred music, or no music. We found that female runners ran further when listening to preferred music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we can probably conclude from our research and other studies, that music generally improves exercise performance. When considering experienced runners or other endurance athletes, the potential for improvement is less. As such, listening to preferred music (c.f., non-preferred music) is less likely to provide a noticeable boost to performance. That considered, music preference has the potential to play an important role in motivation, which can be related to longer and more frequent workouts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened up doors and windows for enhancing the human experience. In the same period, we have seen a growing concern for personal health and wellness. As such, physical activity monitors (PAMs) â most commonly wristbands or phone apps â have become a popular tool for individuals to self-monitor physical activity and set goals. At this point, there is not a lot of information regarding the use of PAMs. For this reason, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://neurophysicole.com/author/darrell-l.-butler-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Darrell Butler&lt;/a&gt; and I conducted focus groups and large-scale surveys of PAM users to better understand their motivation for purchasing and using PAMs, in addition to observing the outcomes individuals with PAMs experience as a result of using the PAMs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conceptual Grouping of Text and Pictures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conceptual grouping is a process that involves processing multiple concepts as a single entity. One popular form of conceptual grouping is chunking. Colloquially, chunking is a strategy explicitly carried out in order to improve memory. Humans are generally capable of holding about 5-7 items in memory at a time, so most may find it difficult to remember the following string fo numbers: &lt;code&gt;9851250923223&lt;/code&gt;. Now, I personally can chunk this string of numbers by recognizing that the first five numbers &lt;code&gt;98512&lt;/code&gt; is the zipcode for Olympia, WA; the next three numbers &lt;code&gt;509&lt;/code&gt; are an area code used in eastern Washington; and the last five numbers &lt;code&gt;23223&lt;/code&gt; are a zipcode for Richmond, VA. So, using my own established knowledge markers, this is actually a fairly easy set of numbers for me to memorize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, how often is it that you are required to memorize a long string of numbers like that?? Okay, occasionally. But thinking more practically, we can consider the more complicated process played by conceptual grouping while reading. As you read a letter, you recall its properties. As you read a word, those letters are grouped into a concept. As you read a sentence, those singular concepts are grouped into a more collective concept. As you read a paragraph, that collective of sentences is unified into a more singular concept. Now letâs think about this. Do you remember the last seven words you read? (Okay, maybe you do..). Do you think you could recall the past five sentences word-for-word? Or, lets make it easier. How about just recalling the topic of each of the past five sentences? That sounds pretty difficult, but I imagine you could probably recall the topic of the last paragraph or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I think you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go further, this study looked at the combination of words and images. It is very common for reading materials, whether they be a textbook, magazine, or a news article, to have images accompanying the main text. Sometimes these images are related to the text, other times they are not. We wondered, do unrelated images disrupt the complex process of conceptual grouping while reading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, we presented participants with cryptic paragraphs, presented one word at a time. Mixed in with the paragraphs were images that were either related, or unrelated to the paragraph. We asked participants to recall the paragraph as well as they could, then to describe the topic of the paragraph. We also had the participants identify the image they were shown (when an image was presented).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to conclude that memory for the paragraph and image was not changed by the relationship of the image to the paragraph, but when presented with an unrelated image, participants were less capable of identifying the topic of the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a second! The memory for the paragraph was the same, but the participants were not able to understand as well what it meant! These findings have widespread implications with regard to the combination of text and images in reading materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phoneme-Grapheme Mapping in Second-Language Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Audiovisual (AV) sensory integration is a vital aspect of communication in everyday life. During speech perception, predictive information from the lips is used to amplify the auditory signal (for a really cool demonstration of this effect, search for videos of the McGurk Effect). AV integration is a process that could substantially improve second language (L2) learning, if applied properly. In many instances, L2 students learn from reading words while listening to pronunciations. There is some doubt as to whether written word provides the necessary predictive information to amplify the auditory signal, particularly when the native alphabet doesnât match the L2 alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we ran two experiments where native English speakers listened to Spanish words while they were simultaneously presented with the same word spelled according to Spanish or English conventions. In the first experiment, participants were asked to mimic the sound they heard. In the second experiment, the participants were asked to indicated which letter the word started with, and to indicate how confident they were in their response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, we found that changing how the words were spelled affected the participantsâ hearing. This means that orthographic information can affect auditory processing, and what is really interesting is that this relationship may be predicated on relevant linguistic knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Study Time vs. Study Strategy</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/project/ma_thesis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time-on-task is often the main concern of individuals planning or reflecting on their preparation an exam. For instance, a teacher may give out recommendations for how long studnets should spend studying for the exma. Or a student may determine that they are prepared by recounting how many hours they spent studying the topic to be examined. The issue with this focus is that task efficiency is often ignored when considering what methods of preparation a student will use to study for the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, most undergraduates are aware that compared to elaborative study strategies, memorization can be less efficient and effective. Despite understanding this, students still rely very heavily on memorizing and regurgitating facts. It does not help matters that even some of the scientific literature focuses on how memorization is improved with increased time-on-task (while ignoring study strategy). In this vein, my advisor and I 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://neurophysicole.com/author/darrell-l.-butler-phd/&#34;&gt;Dr. Darrell Butler&lt;/a&gt; noticed that some of the learning literature appeared to mischaracterize the cognitive effects of study time. Particularly, we found that students who studied longer performed better on tests were considered by some to have obtained a deeper level of knowledge for the topic-at-had. Now, what is important to understand here is that depth of knowledge is built on associations between a variety of information sources. This means that reading, and re-reading the same source does not necessarily result in a deeper level of knowledge, although it may strengthen the memory for that particular material. This means that, theoretically, a shorter study time could be associated with an increased depth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, and disentangle the effects of study time and study strategy on test performance. To do this, we ran two experiments. In both experiments, participants were given an article to read, flashcards to study, and a test to take. The participants studied either deep or shallow level flashcards. In the first experiment, study time was not controlled. In the second experiment, there was a short study time and long study time group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, we were able to confirm that increased study time and more elaborate (deeper) study strategies improved test performance. Furthermore, these effects were not connected, but rather work independently to improve test performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing Conceptual Organization Using Concept Maps</title>
      <link>https://neurophysicole.com/project/concept_mapping/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Organization is necessary for understanding complex concepts. Conceptual organization is developed by establishing associative connections between individual concepts. In order to develop these associations, the learner must consider the relationship between concepts. The trouble is, so many college students rely heavily on memorization strategies when studying  (e.g., memorizing flashcards or re-reading notes or materials). While repetitive recitation strategies can improve memory for particular concepts, these memorization techniques do not provide much, if any, relational information. This means that students often concentrate on learning concepts in isolation, but may not fully understand how these concepts are related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students will generally study to prepare for the demands of the test. As such, tests that require students to exhibit an organizational understanding are used to motivate students to concentrate on organizing learned concepts. To this end, concept maps are becoming an increasingly attractive test format for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the tough part: How do you measure organization? In this study, we tested organization by considering connectedness. We did this by accounting for inaccurate connections in the concept map. When two concepts were inaccurately connected, the two concepts were graded as separate, resulting in multiple âtreesâ in the graded concept map. Graded concept maps with a larger number of trees were considered less connected, and thus exhibited a less organized understanding for the learned material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test organization, we ran multiple experiments comparing learning outcomes for students using concept map, outline, and list study and test formats. Generally speaking, we found that concept maps study and test formats encourage students to develop an organized understanding for the learned material, and outlines were consistently better than lists.&lt;/p&gt;

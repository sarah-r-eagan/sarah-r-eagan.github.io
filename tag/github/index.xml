      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I have setup two websites of my own in addition to developing a couple of other professional websites, but I am certainly not an expert (definitely feel more like a noob than anything). At this point I have established enough of a baseline knowledge of how this all works, so I figured I would share with the world what I have learned, pass along some recommendations, and provide some walk-throughs of what you need to know to build your own website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the story here is that a couple of years ago I decided build my own personal website to increase the visibility of my research, and to provide a platform for sharing my knowledge/thoughts/ideas with the world! Having cut my teeth in web development using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Divi&lt;/a&gt; on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I am talking about here, I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it), I figured I would try and stick with what I knew. I decided to use a free theme on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;. It was fun to build the site, and I was able to design it exactly as I wanted, but in the end, adding content and updating the site became quite a ponderous task - which isn&amp;rsquo;t great when your spare time is limited! So, after a while the website was basically dormant, which didn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with me.. but working on it was such as hassle! Boo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my mind, my website is supposed to be a side project that is part fun and interesting, part professional development, and part something I can do when I don&amp;rsquo;t want to think &lt;em&gt;tooooo&lt;/em&gt; hard. Sometimes I need a brain-break, but I can&amp;rsquo;t (or don&amp;rsquo;t want to) totally shut off, you know what I mean? But with how my initial website was designed, it took a great deal of effort to remember how all of the pieces fit together, and how to even add content like I wanted to..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;Quick note&lt;/em&gt;: This is not a post to bash 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://wordpress.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; websites. I know how some of you peeps think, and I just want to get out ahead of that type of thought! This post is only meant to describe my personal knowledge and experience, which certainly is the end-all be-all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, after a while of being fed up, and after having a little more spare time than usual (kind of), I decided to go the route of building a website using 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Having recently (within the last year or two) discovered 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, and the wonders of Git (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I am talking about, here is a link to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Git Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;). I recently discovered that you could build a website on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and immediately thought that this would be a much more manageable and fun way to build and maintain my website. Now, all of my wbepages are built in Markdown (which I love), and just pushed straight from my computer to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repository hosting the site. At this point it is still pretty early, but I think I have found what I am looking for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lessons-i-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons I Learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point-and-click websites can be fun and easy (kind of) to build, but are a pain to maintain and update (at least in my experience).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point-and-click can come with unexpected expenses, especially if you are interested in plugins or widgets that come with a cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need a ton of technical expertise to build a good website, whether it is developed using point-and-click or more traditional programming methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever you do or buy, research it beforehand! And while doing your research, look up to see how helpful the community resources are! No matter what route you go, you&amp;rsquo;re bound to run into problems, and generally, if you choose carefully, you&amp;rsquo;ll be building on a platform that is well documented and has an active community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be free, it can be cheap, or it can be pricey, and that is completely up to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;walk-throughs&#34;&gt;Walk-Throughs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough with the story telling. In order to keep the information load manageable and organized, I have provided links below to walk-throughs outlining what I have done to develop sites in the past, and what I am currently doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;building-a-site-using-wordpresspostwordpress-blog&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/wordpress-blog/&#34;&gt;Building a Site Using WordPress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Absolutely zero technical/programming expertise needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of resources for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of widgets/plugins to build a custom site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can get spendy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ponderous to maintain and update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;building-a-site-using-github-pagespostgithub-blog&#34;&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;/post/github-blog/&#34;&gt;Building a Site using GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;pros-1&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheap (or free).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses Git!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to fester and tinker with general formatting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;cons-1&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires some basic knowledge of Markdown (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what this is, here is a link to the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Markdown Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires an understanding of how Git works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
